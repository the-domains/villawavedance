description: 'Villa Wave Dance is located in a private gated community on the west end of Cabarete Bay called Bahia de Arena (Bay of Sand). Bahia de Arena is unique in Cabarete because it is the only oceanfront housing development on Cabarete Bay. Villa Wave Dance was conceived to provide maximum privacy and flexibility for our guests. Designed as a duplex, there are 4 bedrooms, 6 bathrooms, 2 living rooms, and two full kitchens. Each side can be locked off from the other depending on the desired lodging arrangements. So, if you are only in need of a 2 bedroom accommodation, you will rent only one side. In addition, each bedroom has it’s own bathroom, air conditioner, and outside access. There is also a wrap around ocean view balcony and 2 private rooftop terraces with spectacular views. Not to mention a private pool, garden, and off street parking. Whether you are a couple, a family with children, one big extended family, or just a group of good friends, Villa Wave Dance offers a variety of accommodation choices that are sure to provide you those private moments you seek and plenty of opportunities to be social and join the fun with your fellow guests. The Bay is the kite surfing epicenter of the Dominican Republic, and possibly the Caribbean. You will be able to see the beach and the kites in the air from just about any living area or balcony at Villa Wave Dance. When you see them you know it’s time to walk to the beach and enjoy the show, or grab your gear and take advantage of one of the over 330 days of kitable wind in Cabarete. Either way, it’s only a 60 second walk from Villa Wave Dance to sticking your toes in the warm ocean water. The Villa has many amenities such as cable, WiFi, safes for valuables, bottled water, a backup generator, and daily maid service. Both kitchens are fully stocked and an outdoor gas grill is provided should you choose to eat in. Bahia de Arena is extremely safe as is Cabarete in general. There is always a guard at the front gate and in a tower on the beach. There is also an extra guard patrols the neighborhood at night. Walking the beach at night is never a problem either. However I would recommend bringing a small flashlight with you for nights when the moon is not bright. A typical day at Villa Wave Dance might go something like this. Wake up with the sunrise and make the 2 minute walk out the front gate of Bahia de Arena to the Cabarete Coffee Company next door. Walk down the boardwalk to the beach, enjoying the soft sand, warm ocean, and gentle breeze or simply lay in the beachfront hammock or lounge chairs shared by the Bahia de Arena community . After your walk, negotiate with the fisherman at the end of the boardwalk and get lobsters to grill for breakfast or lunch (about $5 each). Hang out by the pool and relax or head into town for shopping and adventure. There are a number of activities to do right in Cabarete like yoga, spinning, kitesurfing, windsurfing, paddle boarding, kayaking, boogie boarding, sailing, scuba, or horseback riding on the beach. If you are feeling adventurous you can head to the national forest behind Cabarete Bay and hike waterfalls, repel down waterfalls, zip line, or mountain bike. You can also check out the surfing about 15 minutes down the road in Sosua, where locals and tourists alike line up for the best waves on the island. If you decide press on a little further to Puerto Plata you can catch a movie or swim with the dolphins at Ocean World (which I highly recommend for children… and adults too). For golfing enthusiasts Playa Dorada is 35 minutes west of us and Playa Grande, the Pebble Beach of the Caribbean, is an hour east of us. The prices are reasonable and the courses are beautiful as well as challenging. If you love nature, whale watching starts in January. However, If you just want to relax, there are plenty of options for massages and spas in town. After a long afternoon of adventure or simply relaxing it’s time to clean up and head back to the beach where the restaurants are. Eating out can be as inexpensive or expensive as you want it to be. From a simple hand made happy hour pizza to unbelievable French cuisine. You have many options that are sure to please your budget and your palette. If you choose to dine in great groceries can be found at Janet’s. It is a 50 cent guagua (island taxi) ride or a short walk if you feel like getting some exercise. After dinner, many restaurants turn into night clubs so you can stay and dance the night away or make a quick walk down the beach back to Villa Wave Dance. At night we often enjoyed going up to the roof terrace for a nightcap and to gaze at the stars and the moon reflecting on the ocean. The weather is moderate year round with an average air temperatures of 80 degrees (26.6 Celsius) and an average water temperatures of 78 degrees (26 Celsius). Because of the constant breeze and warm water, the temperatures rarely stray from the averages. Cabarete offers nearly perfect weather all year long, 330 of those days being perfect for kitesurfing, windsurfing, or sailing. For most people seeking a tropical vacation it’s a dream come true. The Villa Wave Dance, the ocean, and the weather are wonderful but it is the people and sense of community in Cabarete that will captivate you. Everyone is friendly whether they are locals or sun seekers like yourself. With people from many countries such as Canada, Australia, Germany, France, Austria, the Netherlands, Finland, and many more.'
